Hi! I'm [DebitKarma](https://twitch.tv/debitkarma), a Twitch streamer, home cook, gamer, programmer, and Linux nerd. 

This is a place where I plan to put things like:

- Public repos of projects I work on live on stream
- Helpful files I want to share with other streamers
- Code for my website, [https://debitkarma.click](https://debitkarma.click/)
- Plaintext items, like recipes, instructions, etc; content for static sites
- OBS scene presets

Come check me out! You can follow me on [Twitter](https://x.com/debitkarmalive) to get go-live notifications!
